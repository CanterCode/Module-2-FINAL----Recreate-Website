## Recreating a Website with Bootstrap and JavaScript

The website that I recreated was [District 142 Concert Venue](https://district142live.com/). It's an event center located in Wyandotte, MI. I liked the style of their website and thought that it was just challenging enough without being too overly complicated.

### Boostrap

I used Bootstrap components throughout the whole website. However, the 3 components that I would like to highlight are the carousel, the cards, and modal. I used these because the original website did and so I thought I could recreate it best with these components. The carousel is on the home page. The cards are used in the events tab. And the modal is the hiring button on the home page.

The hiring button pops up a quiok message that can be changed whether the venue is hiring or not.

### JavaScript

My functions are pretty basic. I wasn'treally sure what all I could do that would relate to the website. I feel fairly comfortable with the basic stuff that we went through in this module. But, i wasn't too sure how to directly apply it to the site. So for my 4 functions...

#### Funtion #1

Just a simple alert whenever someone submits the contact form. I would integrate this to simply thank someone for submitting the form and inform them of some information.

#### Function #2

Calculates the total of a customers order. I used some variable, an array, and the reduce function to add up the prices of items in an order. Then displayed that total in the console. I would integrate this into the menu so that they could pick what they wanted and then it would display the price.

#### Function #3

Validates an email address. If it contains both "." and "@", then it returns "true". If it contains neither, or only one, it returns "false". This would be integrated for the form to ensure a proper email address is used.

#### Function #4

Gives a message dependent on the age of someone trying to submit the contact form. One message for 18+, another message for under 18. used if if.else function for this. This would be integrated into the form as well so that only 18+ can sumbit their information.
